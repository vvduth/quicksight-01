The intent classification confidence score threshold in Amazon Lex is the minimum confidence level that your chatbot must reach to decide it understands the user's request. 
## 💡 What is intent classification confidence score threshold?
For example, if you set this threshold to 0.4, your chatbot will only respond to user input if it is at least 40% confident about the user's intent. If the user's message is unclear and the confidence score is below the threshold (e.g., below 0.4), Lex will not attempt to fulfill the request and will typically prompt the user for clarification or display an error message.

This helps prevent your chatbot from acting on uncertain or ambiguous requests, making conversations clearer and reducing errors.

## I'm building a CI/CD pipeline in 7 days

In this DevOps challenge, I'm learning about several key cloud and DevOps practices. By the end of the 7 days, I will have a complete CI/CD pipeline that takes code from commit to production. Iâ€™ll gain practical DevOps skills that are highly valued in the tech and cloud industry, preparing me for real-world cloud automation and deployment challenges.

## Hold me accountable!

 I will set aside 2 hours every day for a week to work on this challenge. I will keep myself accountable by tracking my daily progress and making sure I complete each step or milestone planned for the day. My reward for completing this DevOps challenge will be a sushi buffet!

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines development (writing code) and operations (deploying and maintaining code) to shorten development cycles and deliver reliable software. DevOps engineers implement these practices in their organizations by:

- Building automated pipelines (using tools like AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions) that test, package, and deploy software, making releases faster and more reliable.
- Containerizing applications with tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale and run consistently across environments.
- Turning cloud infrastructure into code (using services like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform), so teams can efficiently create, manage, and update resources without manual configuration.

Overall, DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently.

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery**.  
- **CI (Continuous Integration)** means the build process starts automatically whenever developers update the code in GitHub. For example, when a new feature or recipe is added, CodeBuild will automatically build and test the updated code.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery)** means deployment happens automatically whenever a new build is successful. This ensures that changes are quickly and reliably pushed to production or staging environments.

This process helps teams by automating repetitive tasks, catching errors early, speeding up releases, and making software delivery more reliable and consistent. It allows developers to focus on writing code while the pipeline handles building, testing, and deploying changes.

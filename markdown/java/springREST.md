## what is rest?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP. RESTful services use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

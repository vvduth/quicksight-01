## I'm building database solutions on AWS

In this AWS Databases series, I‚Äôm learning about database fundamentals and how to manage them in the cloud. By the end of these projects, I will have a solid understanding of how different types of databases work, how to set them up, and how to connect them securely with other AWS services. I‚Äôm learning about cloud databases because they are essential for storing, organizing, and accessing data efficiently in modern applications, and AWS provides powerful, scalable solutions for doing this.

## Excited to share my progress - explore AWS databases with me!

I will set aside 5 days to work on these database projects.

I will keep myself accountable by following my daily plan, taking short notes after each project, and reviewing my progress every evening. I‚Äôll also share my learning results and reflections at the end of the week to stay consistent and motivated.

My reward for completing this AWS Databases series will be a sushi buffet ‚Äî a small celebration to recognize my effort and commitment! üç£üëè

### What are databases?

Databases are organized collections of data that can be easily stored, managed, and accessed. They allow applications to quickly find and use information without needing to search through files manually.

Cloud engineers use databases to store and manage data for applications, websites, and services‚Äîfor example, user accounts, product lists, or analytics. In the cloud, databases are also scalable, secure, and automatically backed up, making them ideal for modern, data-driven systems.

### What do database professionals do?

The most interesting part of their job is designing efficient database structures and writing optimized queries that make applications run fast and smoothly. They get to solve complex data problems, ensure information is stored securely, and analyze data to support decision-making. It‚Äôs a mix of logic, problem-solving, and creativity‚Äîturning raw data into something meaningful and useful.
